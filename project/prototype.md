# Project Prototype

You must create a prototype of your final project, and comment on the prototypes for other students. The goal of this is to force at least one iteration of your project using feedback from other users. 

*You are also encouraged to ask your colleagues to give you feedback at other points in your development process! It is very hard to step back and understand how others less familiar with your data will perceive your visualizations.*

## Prototype Requirements

Your project prototype should be accessible via the link:

```
http://usf-cs360-2016.github.io/templates-cs360/prototype/
```

Replace `templates` with your MyUSF username. You must submit the above link in Canvas.

You should include the following on your prototype website:

- **Prototype:** Include at least one prototype of your planned visualizations. This should be a more advanced prototype! You should have all of the encoding completed, but do not need to have all of your planned interactivity completed. *The more you have done, however, the more useful your prototype will be for your final project.*

- **Dataset Info:** Include a 3 to 5 sentence paragraph describing the data visualized in your prototype.

- **Project Plan:** Include a 3 to 5 sentence paragraph about your planned interactivity, and how this prototype will fit in with your other planned visualizations for your project.

You may use either Tableau or D3 for your prototype. Tableau may be quicker to get working, but D3 will be more immediately useful for your final project. If you use Tableau, you will need to embed the visualization on your website using Tableau Public (similar to your earlier homework).

:bulb: Your prototype grade will be included in the "Final Project" grade category.

## Feedback Requirements

You will be required to comment on 2 to 3 other project prototypes and give detailed, constructive, and substantive feedback. Some questions you might consider addressing are:

- What did you take away from the visualization? Do you think it was informative?

- What did you like about the prototype? These are things you think the creator should *not* change in the final version.

- What did you not like about the prototype? These are things the creator did include, but should maybe change in the final version.

- What do you think is missing? These are things not implemented, but you feel are critical to improving the visualization.

I am expecting several paragraphs worth of text per prototype! Try to give your feedback in terms of data density, data-ink ratio, and lie factor. Try to use proper visualization terms to refer to the type of visualization (multidimensional visualizations like parallel coordinates, geographic visualizations like choropleths, and so on), and types of interactivity (e.g. details on demand via tooltips, focus + context via brushing, overview + detail via linked views, sorting, filtering, and so on).

:bulb: Your feedback grade will be included in the "Participation" grade category.

## Extra Credit

If you volunteer your prototype for a live in-class review, you can earn 5 extra credit points towards the "Final Project" grade category. 

This will involve showing your prototype in-class, followed by a discussion about its pros and cons lead by the instructor. It will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes (5 minutes to present prototype, followed by 5 to 10  minutes of discussion).

**If you wish to do this, please let the instructor know ASAP.**
